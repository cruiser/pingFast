# PingJOy
Let's you ping a server in a press of a key instead of having to type out 'ping x' in cmd or terminal

if you are not running windows you will have to remove the last piece of code in main() that changes console name or it will cause problems, you can also optionally remove the header aswell.

Avoided Advanced logic to keep things simple. If you can't read, the program exits if you enter an invalid key.
